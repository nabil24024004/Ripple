# 💊 About Quick Pill — Complete Product Overview & Guide

> **Quick Pill** is a cross-platform, non-intrusive desktop assistant and Dynamic Island companion for **Windows**, **macOS**, and **Linux**. Floating unobtrusively at the top of your screen, Quick Pill brings real-time system metrics, music controls, notifications, privacy alerts, and productivity widgets right to your fingertips without interrupting your active workspace.

## 📌 1. What is Quick Pill?

**Quick Pill** is an open-source desktop application built on Electron, React 19, and Framer Motion. Inspired by the fluidity of Apple's Dynamic Island, Quick Pill adapts natively to desktop environments.

Unlike traditional widget software or taskbar overlays that take up valuable screen space, Quick Pill rests as a minimal, semicircular capsule when idle. Upon hover or click, it morphs with fluid physics into an interactive control center equipped with 11 feature tabs.

## 💡 2. Purpose & Core Philosophy

The primary objective of Quick Pill is **zero-distraction productivity & unified desktop control**:

1. **Contextual Awareness**: Access vital information (time, weather, battery, playing tracks, notifications) without switching windows or interrupting full-screen applications.
2. **Unified Dashboard**: Consolidate hardware monitoring, media controls, task management, clipboard history, and system alerts into one single interface.
3. **Fluid UI Physics**: Powered by spring physics (`stiffness: 340, damping: 28`), the island expands and contracts smoothly based on your cursor interaction.
4. **Click-Through Translucency**: Hold `Control` while hovering to make the island 85% translucent and completely click-through, allowing you to click elements directly behind it.
